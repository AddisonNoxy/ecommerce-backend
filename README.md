# Ecommerce Backend App
A small app meant to simulate changes in a database using Sequelize, Insomnia, and MySQL.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your machine. Run "npm i" to install the required dependencies. Use the MySQL shell to run db/schema.sql, then run "npm run seed" to seed the created database and allow for interactions with the data.

## Usage
Enter your server information into the .env file in the app. Start the server with "node server.js", then open Insomnia and navigate to the correct api routes for interacting with the data.

GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes can be used to alter the data in the database.
